# Elevate-Labs-Task-1
This repository contains the results of Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing. The objective was to clean a raw dataset, addressing issues like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting, to create a structured and analysis-ready dataset.
FeatureDetailDataset UsedMedical Appointment No Shows (sourced from Kaggle)Tool StackPython (Pandas)Deliverablesdata_cleaning.ipynb (Code), cleaned_medical_appointments.csv (Output), and this README.md.🛠️ The Data Cleaning Pipeline (6 Core Steps)The cleaning process was executed using Pandas in a structured Jupyter Notebook environment, adhering to the principles of data standardization and integrity.1. Standardization of Column Headers ✨Action: Applied a global transformation to ensure all column names are clean and consistent.Method: Converted all headers to snake_case (e.g., PatientId $\rightarrow$ patient_id) by enforcing lowercase and replacing spaces and hyphens with underscores.2. Duplicate Removal 🗑️Action: Checked for and eliminated any rows that were exact duplicates of previous entries.Method: Utilized the powerful df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True) command.Impact: Ensures that aggregate statistics and model training are not skewed by redundant records.3. Data Type Integrity Check (D-Type Fixes) 📆Action: Verified and corrected the data types for critical columns.Method:Converted scheduledday and appointmentday from generic string objects to native datetime64[ns] objects using pd.to_datetime(). This enables accurate time-based calculations.Ensured the age column was correctly cast as a reliable integer type.4. Text Standardization for Categorical Data 🔡Action: Ensured all text-based categories were consistent to prevent misclassification.Method:gender: Converted all values to uppercase (e.g., 'F', 'M') for uniformity.neighbourhood: Used .str.strip() to remove unseen whitespace, followed by .str.title() for consistent naming.5. Handling Data Quality Issues (Impossible Values) 🩹Action: Addressed known illogical entries within the dataset.Method: Filtered out and removed all rows where the age value was negative (age < 0), as this is physically impossible and an indicator of bad data collection.6. Final Data PreparationAction: The dataset was saved to a new CSV file.Output: The result is cleaned_medical_appointments.csv, which is immediately ready for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and subsequent predictive modeling.
